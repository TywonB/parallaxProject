            <h3>INSPIRATION</h3>
            There is no time to just sit and relax while the world goes by. It is up to you to make a change. Not everything will be given to you, you have to get up and go and accomplish what you want. You have to overcome any obstacle that stands in your way. God will test you and although you may fail most that come towards you, you just have to remind yourself that you have to get up and try again and again and again until you are truly satisfied.
